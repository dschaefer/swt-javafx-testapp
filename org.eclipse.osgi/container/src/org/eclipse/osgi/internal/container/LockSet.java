 * Implementation note: This class does not pool ReentrantLocks for the objects
 * that are being locked.  This means that if the same object is locked and unlocked
 * over and over then new ReentrantLocks are created each time.  This set should be
 * used with care.  If the same object is going to be locked/unlocked over and over then
 * consider using a different locking strategy.
 * 
 * Previous implementations of this class attempted to use a WeakHashMap to cache
 * the locks, but this proved to be a flawed approach because of the unpredictable
 * timing of garbage collection, particularly with autoboxed types (e.g. bundle
 * long ids).
